# two-temperature-paper
This is a post-processing github repository to analyze a large number of HIT-SI simulations run using a single or two-temperature Hall-MHD model implemented in two MHD codes, NIMROD and PSI-Tet. This analysis will be published to show new physical understanding of HIT-SI plasmas with this more complex plasma model.
